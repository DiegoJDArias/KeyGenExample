# KeyGenExample
Example in Assembly x86

A keygen is a tool (usually a program) used to generate activation keys (license keys) for licensed software. Its use is generally illegal.

These keys are sometimes required to activate the software and allow it to function, but creating and using these keygen-generated keys violates the software's license agreement and can have legal consequences, including financial penalties.

In short, a keygen attempts to circumvent the software's activation system, which is not permitted. Be careful!.
